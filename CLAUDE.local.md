- always start the dev web server with port 8002
- before starting the dev web server, check to make sure the port is available. If it's not, kill it becuase you forgot you started it.
- use ios-simulator to do native app testing
- to start the app you need to make sure metro is not running, then you can cd into packages/native-app and run "npx expo run:ios"... just remember it's a forever running process.
